# AdminProExtension

This is the new AdminPro Extension for Google Chrome. When you click on the icon in your extension bar, it brings up a popup with a few options. A big part of the opening screen is the logviewer. This is a fast way to keep an eye on the server if you have a few seconds. There are 4 options in the bar above it. It offers player list, forum and Permban List. The player list option shows you the online players. The Forum button brings you directly to the forum. The Permban list button brings you to the permban list, which is great for permban appeals to see them on the list. The rest of the buttons are link Buttons
